You can adapt Netlify CMS to a wide variety of projects. It works with any content written in markdown, JSON, YAML, or TOML files, stored in a repo on GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket. You can also create your own custom backend.

This tutorial guides you through the steps for adding Netlify CMS to a site that's built with a common static site generator, like Jekyll, Hugo, Hexo, or Gatsby. Alternatively, you can start from a template or dive right into configuration options.
